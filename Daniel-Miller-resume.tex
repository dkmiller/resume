\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}
Senior data scientist working with \href{https://www.microsoft.com/}{Microsoft's} \href{http://www.exp-platform.com/}{Analysis and Experimentation} team, building frameworks to help Microsoft accelerate innovation through trustworthy experimentation.
Have experience leading diverse teams in building large-scale products while maintaining a clean, abstract codebase and fostering an ``open source style'' culture of document-driven development.
Worked with Bing to analyze petabyte-scale data sets, optimize data pipelines, and conduct thousands of statistically rigorous online controlled experiments.
Interested in leveraging mathematical skills in building platforms that democratize insights, in a fast-paced, collaborative, environment.
