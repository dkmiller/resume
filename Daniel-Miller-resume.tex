\begin{cventries}

\cventry
  {Principal data science manager, Microsoft}
  {}{}
  {June 2017--present}
  {
    \begin{cvitems}
      \item{Architected support for \href{https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-ml-federated-learning}{cross-silo federated learning in Azure ML} and drove adoption both inside and outside Microsoft.}
      \item{Led development and maintence of a Python library and CLI \href{http://shrike-docs.com/}{Shrike}, with hundreds of internal users.}
      \item{Developed data science practice and tooling to drive the migration of over 1000 GUI-based data science workloads to code-based approach on Azure ML.}
      \item{Spearheaded the cross-team development of a \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00913}{compiler} for transforming human-readable metric definitions into code for running trustworthy statistical analysis in multiple compute platforms.}
      \item{Primary contact for experimentation at Bing, helping to triage dozens of trustworthiness issues, aid product owners in understanding the user impact of their experiments, and improve the cost and reliability of analysis pipelines.}
      \item{Built a framework for comparing the parity of production-scale data pipelines, enabling trustworthy framework migrations.}
      \item{Developed a framework for metric lifecycle for Bing, saving 10\% compute cost and making ship decisions easier.}
